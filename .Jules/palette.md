## 2025-01-24 - Layout Robustness and Validation
**Learning:** Absolute positioning for interactive elements like removal buttons can create "dead zones" or "ghost click areas" that confuse users, especially on smaller screens or dynamic layouts. Using a dedicated grid column is more reliable.
**Action:** Always prefer grid or flexbox for alignment over absolute positioning for interactive elements.

## 2025-01-24 - Duplicate Data Prevention
**Learning:** Preventing duplicate names at the entry point is a simple but high-impact UX win that prevents downstream calculation errors and user confusion.
**Action:** Implement case-insensitive duplicate checks for list-based inputs.

## 2025-01-24 - Clipboard Feedback Pattern
**Learning:** For "Copy to Clipboard" features, a temporary UI state change (e.g., button text "✅ Copied!" and color shift) provides immediate and clear confirmation to the user, improving trust and usability.
**Action:** Always provide visual feedback after clipboard actions, using temporary state changes.
